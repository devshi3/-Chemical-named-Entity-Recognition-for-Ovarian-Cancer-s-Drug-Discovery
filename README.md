Biomedical text mining, which is utilized for extracting
valued information from biomedical papers, named
entity recognition is a critical task. Drug NER is a
crucial step in advanced biomedical NLP applications
including pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic, and
pharmacogenomics parameter abstraction. The
number of scientific papers is continually increasing,
allowing to expand understanding of health, clinical,
and biological sciences. Because the acquired findings
are not currently archived automatically, most of this
information is concealed in the textual contents, making
it unreachable for later use or study. Because the
amount of time and effort necessary to extract critical
information from such a large number of articles is so
great, no pre-existing dataset devoted specifically to
ovarian cancer has been discovered. As a result,
proposed research created a dataset from scratch to
train the suggested model on. Proposed research
discussed methods to drug development in Ovarian
cancer using Chemical Named Entity Recognition in
this publication.
Results: BiLSTM which stands for Bi-directional long
short-term memory along with CRF, proposed research
to present a Named Entity Recognition system for
chemical entities. On the basis of the dataset proposed
research created, proposed research evaluates the
model. For CNER, the model achieved an F1-score of
0.91 on this dataset. Proposed research find that
technique performs admirably for biomedical NER
problems. Conclusion: The suggested method is
effective in recognizing chemical entities in ovarian
cancer-related literature.
